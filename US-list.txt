1. As a student, I want to know within two seconds whether each class on my list has availble sections, because I want feedback to feel instant.
2. As a student, I want to list as many as 100 potential classes, so that I can see as many options as possible.
3. As a student, I want to have the option to sort the class list by shortest waitlist, so that it is easiest to see that classes I have the best chance of getting.
