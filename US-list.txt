Kevin:
1. As a student, I want to know within two seconds whether each class on my list has availble sections, because I want feedback to feel instant.
2. As a student, I want to list as many as 100 potential classes, so that I can see as many options as possible.
3. As a student, I want to have the option to sort the class list by shortest waitlist, so that it is easiest to see that classes I have the best chance of getting.

Brandon:
1. As a student, I want to see all classes available for a given quarter in a specific GE category so that I can choose one or more to include in my schedule.
2. As a student, I want to see all open classes that count toward my degree progress in a given quarter so that I can choose one or more to include in my schedule.
3. As a student, I want to see all open classes that match my availability so that I can choose one or more to include in my schedule.

1. As a student, I want to search for my classes by name, so that I can see all of the class's sections.
2. As a student, I want to save my list of selected classes, so that I can bring it up later.
3. As a student, I want to filter my selected classes by start time, so that I only select classes that start in the afternoon.

Justin:
1. As an engineering department advisor at Cal Poly, I want to see which additional classes are most likely to fit with a studentâ€™s preexisting schedule, so I can help students in an easier and more streamlined fashion.
2. As a computer science major, I wish to see which tech electives have the shortest waitlists, so that I can better register for classes.
3. As a member of the General Education Coordination Committee, I wish to evaluate how the general availability of GE courses changes through the time elapsed during the registration rotations, so I can argue for pertinent changes to the way GE courses are offered to better serve the student body.
